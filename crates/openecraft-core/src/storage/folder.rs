//! The split format on disk: a project folder with the index file (`<name>.oecp`)
//! and the folders `pages`, `data` and `files` next to it. Other files of the folder
//! are left alone; a folder without a `.gitattributes` gets one, so that git leaves
//! the files as they are.
//!
//! A project has thousands of files, so what a save costs is counted in files:
//!
//! - A save writes the files that changed and removes those of deleted pages and
//!   records. A working copy that remembers the files as it read them ([`Tracked`])
//!   neither reads the folder again nor writes a page it did not change, and it
//!   tells its own changes from those of another program (git, another editor).
//! - A save is one step: the changed files are written next to the old ones, a
//!   journal names them, and only then they take their places. A crash before the
//!   journal leaves the project as it was; after it, the next access finishes the
//!   save. (A power failure can still lose what the system had not written yet.)
//! - Files are found with the times and sizes the folder listing gives, and read
//!   and written on all threads.
