# Changelog

The notable changes of each OpenECraft release. The section of a version is the text of
its GitHub release ([docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md)).

## [0.1.1] - unreleased

- **Updates in the editor:** when it starts, the editor looks for a new release on
  GitHub in the background, downloads it, checks it against `SHA256SUMS` and installs
  it: the Windows setup runs silently when the editor is closed (*Restart and update*
  in the status bar starts it again afterwards), an AppImage and the macOS apps are
  replaced at once; packages of a distribution are only told of the new version.
  Without a connection nothing waits. *File › Help › Check for updates* looks at any
  time; *Settings › Updates* and `OPENECRAFT_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` switch the check at start
  off ([installation](docs/installation.md#updates)).
- **Docker images of the servers:** the parts server and the project server are
  published as `ghcr.io/nilres/openecraft-parts-server` and
  `ghcr.io/nilres/openecraft-project-server` with every release (`<version>`, `latest`)
  and every push to master (`edge`); `installer/docker/compose.yaml` starts both
  ([installation](docs/installation.md)).
- **Directed T-junctions (target tracing):** *Insert › Connections › T-junction*
  places a junction where three wires meet that names the device the two wires of the
  connection start from and the order of their targets, with four directions and four
  variants each as in the connection symbols of EPLAN; the connection list, diagrams,
  panel wiring and harnesses follow it, connections without one keep the schematic
  order. The junction can be drawn as a dot without losing its routing, turns and
  mirrors with the drawing, is kept in the project file and the undo history, and is
  checked against its wires (*Connection symbols* check). Commands `add_t_junction`,
  `update_connection_symbol` and `list_connection_symbols` for the command line and the
  MCP server ([#96](https://github.com/nilres/OpenECraft/issues/96)).
- **Corners for automatic wiring:** *Insert › Connections › Corner* places a connection
  symbol with two arms at a right angle; with *Auto-connect* on, connection points that
  face the free arms of a corner or a T-junction are wired to it when the symbol or the
  device is placed or moved, so a corner at the meeting point of two connections wires
  both of them in. Command `add_corner` (with `autoconnect`), and `autoconnect` takes
  connection symbols too ([#96](https://github.com/nilres/OpenECraft/issues/96)).
- **Directed crossings and bridges:** *Insert › Connections › Crossing* connects the two
  wires crossing at its point (unconnected without one) and leads each end of its
  vertical or horizontal line straight on first and across second, in two variants;
  *Bridge* leads a connection from one side to the three others, the opposite side
  first. Both follow the connection symbols of EPLAN, can be drawn as a dot and keep
  their routing, and the check reports a connection its symbols wire in a loop. Commands
  `add_crossing` and `add_bridge` ([#96](https://github.com/nilres/OpenECraft/issues/96)).
- **Editor:** wires attached to moved items stay square: they slide along their rails,
  or get a jog where they cannot. Connection definition points and cable definition
  lines stay on their wires.

- **3D routing in cabinets without cable ducts:** their wires are no longer laid
  along the mounting plate (through the devices and each other) but routed in 3D from
  connection point to connection point, like the wires of a room: clear of everything
  by half their thickness, bent with their radius only, each on a way of its own. A
  wire that finds no such way is reported as an error instead of being drawn.
- **3D routing:** a route leaves a connection point that lies inside the box of its
  device straight through that box, never through another device to the room behind
  it; its last bend may lie where the straight way into
  its end begins; the straight way out of every connection point and cable entry stays
  free until its own route is laid; a cable between two cabinets that stand in no
  common room is routed to a cable entry in each of them; every cable takes an entry of
  its own; in the 3D view a cable passing from one cable duct into the next keeps under
  the cover of the first.
- **Bend radius in the 3D view:** ways laid side by side change lanes on a slanting
  piece of a stretch instead of a step at the corner (which was rounded with a radius
  of a millimetre or two); a route is drawn straight out of its connection points, its
  first corners moved onto that line, instead of with a kink onto the routing grid; a
  jog shorter than the bends of its corners is an S-curve of the bend radius also where
  the stretches before and after it lean; bends are drawn as fine arcs, so that ways
  round one corner are not pushed apart where only their drawn arcs met; a cable ends
  on its bend where its cores part right behind a corner.
- **3D routing, crossings:** routes that come together lie side by side, a route no
  longer runs across another one (only on its own way out of a connection point, or
  where it comes up to the device the other one ends at, and there it goes round the
  other one too where that costs little); the way out of a connection point is shared
  only by a route out of a point right beside it; of the wires of a cabinet as thick
  as each other the shortest is routed first, so that between two devices the inner
  conductors lie nearest to them and the outer ones go round them. Two wires that
  still cross right at a device are lifted over each other more sharply than their
  radius allows.
- **Cable entry flanges:** the cables through one flange go through its membrane side
  by side, each at a place of its own (the cable's thickness and a centimetre apart,
  the free place nearest to where the cable heads) instead of all through its middle;
  the cores of a cable part within the box of their ends, so that a core no longer
  swings out past its terminal into the bars it sits on.
- **Busbar holders in the 3D view:** drawn at the drilling positions of the plate (a
  holder 25 mm from each end and every 250 mm) instead of every 400 mm, and moved
  beside the devices that sit in the bars (current transformers the bars pass through)
  instead of through them. The bars, their holders and the boxes of busbar terminals
  and strip elements without a model were wound inside out: the view showed their
  far faces, which flickered against the holders behind the bars and the plate.
- **Messages of the 3D routing:** a message about a cable, hose or wire (not
  routable, bends too tight, frozen route lost, hose too short) points at a connection
  point of it: a double click in the messages pane jumps to the schematic. The 3D
  view marks a cable, tube or wire that could not be routed (and so is not drawn)
  with a red note at each of its ends, with the reason.
- **Busbar terminals in the 3D routing:** each terminal of a strip across the bars is
  a solid of its own: a wire to one of them goes round the others instead of through
  them (a cable whose cores end at several of them comes up through those). Terminals
  closer than 30 mm along the bars are entered from the front: their points facing a
  neighbour leave to the front, as a wire has no way out between them.
- **Cores at busbar terminals:** a cable ends clear of the device its cores go to,
  and the cores to terminals one above the other on the bars pass the lower terminals
  in front of them instead of through them. In example 13 the supply cable comes to
  its busbar terminals from below, through a gland in line with them, instead of
  looping round the field to come down onto them.
- **3D routing, ends:** a route comes into an end against the direction it leaves it
  in also where the way out is a single cell (it could run past the connection point
  and back into it); where the way straight out of an end is barred and the route
  starts from the cell beside it, the way out must be long enough for an S-bend of the
  bend radius onto that line; cable glands of the examples lie in line with the
  connection points they serve.
- **Busbar systems:** the systems of bayed enclosures that meet at their common side
  are one system (devices on it are connected by its bars in either enclosure); a
  section shorter than the system is wide lies along its bars; the connection points
  of repeated accessories (a current transformer behind each pole of a strip) are told
  apart by their number (`2S1`).
- **Parts:** current transformer sets with their connection points (primaries through
  from the bottom to the top, secondaries on a terminal block), the leads of the
  transformers behind NH strips.
- **Examples 13 and 14** rebuilt so that every conductor can be laid: power flows
  through the fields from one device into the next, busbar cross-sections run over
  bars (transformer sets in the busbars, the distribution busbar through both cabinets,
  coupling switches fed from busbar terminals), taps to small devices have their own
  cross-sections; the string fuses of the generator junction box of example 11 stand
  above their terminals.
- **Buildings:** buildings with levels and shafts in the plant; rooms stand on the
  levels and move with their building, shafts and links between buildings (cable
  trench, conduit, cable bridge between building entries) carry routes from room to
  room; devices go on the outside of the walls and on the roof; a Buildings pane with
  a site plan, the plugin `buildings` with its commands, a check and example 15.

- Use the DIN-rail clip position from imported mounting data when placing cabinet devices. Matching Beckhoff terminal housings and the EK1100 use the documented 63.8 mm rail datum.

- Snap cabinet devices flush to a nearby neighbor on the mounting plate while placing or moving a single module. The placement preview shows the snapped position.

- Show imported EPLAN artwork on cabinet fronts. An assigned front view takes priority, followed by a mounting representation and then a fitted overview illustration.

- Place successive imported PLC channels from a single card entry in the Insert center; when a card fills up, placement continues on a new device.

- Link PLC channels placed from the symbol library to their uniquely matching catalog article, so the physical card appears once in the cabinet's devices-to-place list. Opening an existing project or reimporting the article also recovers unassigned cards.

- Import Beckhoff analog signal and reference terminals as one PLC channel with a symbolic name such as U1, keeping both wire endpoints and the source data type.

- Import single-channel EPLAN digital I/O representations as native PLC points with editable addresses, physical terminal designations, and one parts-list entry per card.

- Reuse unchanged symbol drawings during part dragging and schematic rendering, including large imported EPLAN libraries.

- Import embedded 2D graphics from EPLAN window macros into the project symbol library. EDZ parts carry their converted variants and per-variant diagnostics through the parts server.
- Import additional SPECIAL contact forms and verified reciprocal potential transfers. Report unresolved source objects and their terminal designations per representation. Explicit reimport preserves placed wire endpoints and instance pin labels when compatible contacts are added.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-04

The first release: an electrical CAE editor for Windows, Linux, macOS and the browser,
with a command line, an MCP server, a parts server and a project server.

- **Schematics:** device-oriented pages with live cross references and contact images,
  structure identifiers, page sections, macros with variants and a configurator;
  potentials, cables with cores and automatic wire, device and page numbering.
- **Symbols:** about 330 IEC 60617 symbols, NFPA / JIC, GB, GOST and JIS sets, fluid
  power (ISO 1219), P&ID, installation plans and single-line; a symbol editor.
- **Terminals, plugs, PLC:** multi-level terminals with accessories, plugs, PLC tag
  tables for TIA Portal, Studio 5000, TwinCAT, CODESYS and more, marker export.
- **Connectors:** the plug window shows the pin-out of a plug on the mating faces of
  both sides, coloured by the wires and cable cores at the pins (also as SVG export);
  connector parts for M5, M8, M12 (signal, fieldbus, Ethernet and power codings),
  M16, M23, M40, 7/8", GX aviation connectors, valve connectors, D-sub, DIN 41612,
  IDC, wire-to-board housings, pluggable terminal blocks, RJ11 / RJ12 / RJ45, BNC,
  heavy duty inserts, sealed connectors for mobile machines, CEE, appliance couplers,
  mains, installation, PV and battery connectors; pin layouts with inner rings,
  column numbering and free pin positions; ribbon and flat cables with a check of the
  cores on IDC connectors; example project 12 shows them.
- **Reports and checks:** live report pages, graphical terminal, cable and plug
  diagrams, drawn forms, a project check with message management and a check for
  open wire ends.
- **Editor:** an EPLAN-style ribbon that folds groups into menus when space is short,
  dockable panes per workspace with standard workspaces to return to their default
  arrangement, an Insert center, a properties pane, key tips,
  command search; unsaved changes are kept and asked for on every way out; released
  and locked pages are read only but selectable; crossing selection, zoom commands,
  contextual help (F1) and rebindable keys for every page action; pages and sections
  are dragged in the Pages navigator with a drop marker and the resulting name shown.
- **Panel layout:** devices at real size in 2D and 3D, virtual wiring with duct fill,
  drilling and NC data, enclosure climate, line-ups, rooms and 3D routing; wiring and
  mounting assistants for the workshop. In a room's floor plan cabinets turn in place,
  cabinets in a bad place are drawn in the warning colour with the reason on hover,
  inner walls end on the room walls, and the layout checks are shown below the view;
  rooms and enclosures with content are deleted only after a question. Opening a project
  analyses it in the background with a window showing the step and the route it is
  at; the 3D routing searches several times faster and is kept while an edit changes
  none of its routes; after an edit that does, it is searched in the background (the
  status bar shows it, the 3D view keeps the earlier routes until then), so editing
  a project with rooms no longer stalls the editor for seconds. Exports, reading 3D
  model and parts files (STEP, IGES, Parasolid, EDZ, …) and the autosave run on another
  thread too; the status bar shows what is running. Pipes and cables in a room keep to
  its walls and ceiling instead of crossing it, and their bends keep the bend radius
  apart. The 3D view is drawn by the graphics card (OpenGL 3 / WebGL 2, with a depth
  buffer and anti-aliasing; Settings › Appearance switches it off), and drawn by the
  processor it keeps what it shows between frames: large rooms turn smoothly. Moving in the
  3D view: the wheel zooms at the pointer and walks on into a room, Shift+drag pans as the
  right button does, a double-click turns the camera to what was clicked and closes in,
  W A S D / the arrow keys and Q E move through it (Shift: faster), and a bar in the view
  has the standard views (front, left, right, rear, top, isometric) and *Fit* (`Home`). Devices without a 3D
  model of their own get a detailed, coloured one by what they are (pumps, vessels,
  valves, heat pumps, inverters, rack batteries, …); devices of the bundled catalogs
  (Victron, Pylontech, Hager, DEHN, Beckhoff, Phoenix Contact, Siemens) are drawn after
  their product photos and wired to their real terminals: the Pylontech batteries
  to the power terminals and ports on their front, the Victron devices from below,
  the Cerbo GX at its row of connectors, Beckhoff terminals at their spring contacts,
  surge arresters with the earth at the bottom, 19-inch devices at the rear; DIN rail
  models have a screw at every connection point; terminal blocks are drawn slice by
  slice with their stepped profile, wire entries, pushers or screws and marker fields
  (generic terminals, end covers and end brackets sized after Phoenix Contact PT, PTPOWER,
  D-ST, D-PT and CLIPFIX), between end plates and end brackets at both ends of every strip, and cable ducts with slotted walls and their
  cover; cables in the 3D routing end at the
  connection points their cores land on and part into their cores there; routes leave the devices they end at
  instead of running through them; the routes of a class are searched on several threads
  at once (with the same result), a selected cable or tube shows its properties like a
  wire with its cores and the connection points they join (picked in the 3D view and on the plate); a cabinet opened from its room is fitted into the view. The 3D view hides the
  walls in front of the camera or the
  ceiling on request; the opacity of the walls is a setting. Wires are drawn in their
  colours and, like cables and tubes, in their real thickness as round tubes bent round
  their corners with their bend radius, from the plate up to their
  connection points; cable cores are drawn with their cable. Routes keep half their
  thickness from what is around them and turn where their bends have room, cables keep
  out of cable ducts too small for them; View › Open cable ducts leaves out the covers
  of the ducts. Wires, cables and tubes that run together lie side by side, each on a lane of its own
  (in a cable duct packed in rows from its base, never over its cover), and where wires and cables pass
  through the wall of a duct its fingers are left out; where they would still run inside or through each
  other they are pushed apart, one over the other where they cross, inside the walls of their cabinet and
  out of its devices. Wires on one terminal or on terminals closer than they are thick leave them
  straight, side by side, instead of hooking round each other where they come out of a duct. The 3D
  view lays them out on another thread, several times faster, with a progress box while it does (it
  shows them as routed until then). Cables and tubes keep apart from each other in free air already when they are
  routed. A cable duct too small for its wires to lie side by side is an error of the project check.
  The fill level of a cable duct counts the cables and tubes routed through it as well as its wires,
  against the cross section inside the duct, also for the ducts on the walls, ceiling and floor of a
  room; cables and tubes keep out of the stretches of a duct they would fill above the limit.
  A cable ends a little before the device and its cores part from there in smooth curves, each coming
  into its connection point from the side its wires leave it; cables and wires run on through the cable
  glands, wall penetrations and cable passages between cabinets and rooms in one piece, bent round
  there; pipes and hoses end at the nozzles of the devices' models (suction and pressure nozzle of a
  pump, the nozzles of a vessel, both ends of a valve), coming straight out of them; a valve, meter or
  check valve in a pipe is taken as mounted with its inlet towards the pipe that feeds it. Cables
  through one gland pass it side by side; the cores of a cable are as thick as its diameter tells and
  part from their places round its axis. Wires in a cabinet without cable ducts leave their devices
  in the direction of their connection points and run round the rows of devices instead of behind or
  through them; wires leave their own devices over them, not through them. Wires, cables and pipes
  laid side by side are pushed at most a few times their thickness from their routes.
  The 3D routing measures the room around a route from the devices, walls, mounting
  plate, door and room walls themselves (thin busbars and rails between the cells of its
  grid included), so cables and pipes keep half their thickness from all of them, and
  from each other, everywhere: a route that cannot is not routed, and the project check
  reports it as an error that says to move its ends or make room for it. A route leaves
  its device, cable gland, nozzle or wall penetration straight on for its bend radius,
  runs two radii between two bends (the arcs of both fit between), turns only where its
  arc keeps clear of everything too, changes lanes with an S-bend (checked and drawn as
  one), and near its ends converges with the routes to the same end; the thickest cables
  of a class are routed first. In a cabinet a cable enters and leaves a cable duct through
  the slots of its walls, never through its base or its cover, lies in a duct over the rim
  of its walls and under its cover, and keeps half its thickness off the ducts it runs
  along outside them; in a 19-inch rack cables run along the space beside the mounting
  rails and leave it for their devices; in a room, running through the open space costs
  the more the farther from its surfaces, so cables and pipes keep close to the ceiling
  and the walls. The 3D view holds wires and cables in that band of a duct where they
  cross its walls (and leaves out the fingers they pass), cuts a duct's walls where
  another duct joins it, and brings a wire down before the next duct instead of into it
  through its cover, down beside the hinge of the door before the duct along the plate's
  edge, and straight through a cable passage for its bend radius on both sides. A cable
  takes the nearest cable gland whose clamping range fits it and that no other cable
  took, the thickest cables first, and a route whose way into its end runs beside it
  changes lanes into it with an S-bend. A connection takes the cross-section of a wire
  drawn with one at its connection point (a tap off a busbar) rather than the busbar's.
  Every wire, cable and tube has a least bend radius, a multiple of its thickness from
  the routing rules (wires and cables four times it, as laid fixed; hoses five times it
  or their own; pipes one and a half times it, a long-radius elbow), shown in the route
  and wire properties: the 3D view bends every corner with it, and corners too close for
  separate arcs as one smooth curve no tighter than it where the stretches around
  allow; wires through one cable passage pass it side by side, and two wires on one
  terminal leave it side by side. The wires of a room are routed in 3D between the
  devices on its walls (a room has no mounting plate to route them along); wires routed
  in 3D keep apart from the cables and from each other like cables do, outside the ducts
  and routing paths; cables and tubes are routed before the wires of a class; and a
  route comes up to another near its end only where that route is near one of its ends
  too (cables converging on one gland or terminal), not across its run. The 3D view
  keeps the wires and cables out of the walls, bases and covers of the cable ducts
  (crossing the walls where they are held above the rim), lays the cores of a cable
  where they part as they are and the rest clear of them, joins the legs of a route at
  a cable gland with the corner before it in line instead of a slanted run, and lets
  the cables of a rack run behind its 19-inch panels. A test of the editor checks that
  nothing drawn in the 3D views of the example projects clips anything: other wires,
  cables and pipes (beyond the overlap the layout leaves where they are packed: a
  millimetre and a half between wires, two and a half millimetres where a cable or pipe
  is involved), the ducts with their covers, the devices, the walls, plates and doors of
  the cabinets and the walls, floors and ceilings of the rooms. In the building example
  the incoming terminals of the main distribution feed the busbar they are mounted on,
  its feeder ducts are deeper, and the shunt sits between the first two Lynx
  distributors on the technical room's wall. A device standing on the floor of a room
  without connection points of its own is connected on top, where its terminal box is.
  Devices mounted on a busbar system are connected by its bars instead of wires. The title bar can show
  the frame time and the frames per second (Settings › Appearance). A placed device is shown in the
  panel layout or the 3D view from its context menu in the schematic. Pumps, tanks
  and other parts marked for floor mounting stand on the floor of a room; a pump or
  compressor without its own motor names its motor (property "Driven by") and is drawn
  coupled to it: through a shaft coupling (or a gear unit) in line, through V-belts (or a
  gear case) side by side, the motor turned towards it and raised on a riser. Pipe runs
  go on its walls, ceiling and floor, and hoses, pipes and cables are routed in 3D
  through the room and from its cabinets through their cable glands. Wall
  penetrations join neighbouring rooms: routes run from room to room through them
  (also through the rooms between), and the floor plan shows the rooms around the one
  shown, opened with a double-click. **19-inch racks** (42 U in 2000 mm) have mounting
  rails instead of a plate; switches, patch panels, servers, UPS and blank panels snap
  onto whole rack units, with a rack elevation report and the commands `add_rack`,
  `mount_in_rack` and `list_racks`. **Building entries** in outer walls bring the
  supply cable and the water main into the building: cables and pipes to devices
  outside the building are routed to them. Of several wall penetrations into the same
  room a route takes the nearest; cables and pipes ending at the same device (a heat
  pump) may meet there, also when the device is in a cabinet standing in the room:
  the cable comes in through the building entry and on through the cabinet's gland.
  Cabinets hanging on a wall are entered through the glands in their bottom too: a
  shaft below each gland, open to the front, stays free for the routes. A new enclosure system for **house connection
  boxes** (glass-fibre reinforced polyester with a hinged cover); in the building
  example the house connection box is such an enclosure above the cable entry, with
  the NH fuse base of the utility (fed from below) and the PEN terminal block inside,
  and a main earthing busbar beside it joins the PE busbar of the main distribution
  (main bonding conductor) and the foundation earth electrode, whose stainless steel
  lug comes out of the wall below it; the earth electrode is a new symbol.
- **Engineering:** conductor sizing (`size_wires` gives the wires behind protective
  devices the cross-section they need; fuse switch disconnectors protect at the rating
  of their fuse links), short circuit and selectivity, load calculation,
  EMC, ISO 13849-1 safety functions; wire harnesses with KBL (their wires stay assigned when pages or symbols move), fluid
  power, pre-planning. Fluid power and P&ID symbols for air receivers, dryers,
  lubricators, quick couplings, heat pumps and buffer tanks, the media hot water and
  heating water; symbols for energy meters, PV generators, hybrid inverters, inverter /
  chargers, valve actuators and motor-operated valves. A device drawn pole by pole (fuse
  holders, surge arresters, fuse blocks) may have as many main functions as its parts
  provide. Symbols for the motor operator of a circuit breaker and the voltage and
  frequency relay of a grid and system protection (VDE-AR-N 4105). The voltage drop of
  a cable takes the rated current of the part providing the function it feeds (the
  motor operator, not the breaker it sits on). A fuse switch disconnector with solid
  links isolates only: no protection, no selectivity. Cable entry flanges are ways in
  for the 3D routing like cable glands. The check `busbars` finds busbar systems whose
  devices join more conductors than they have bars (a short circuit); the 3D view and
  the 3D exports draw each bar of a busbar system on its own, at the part's centre
  distance, on holders reaching just across the bars (their own solids in the 3D
  exports). A busbar terminal strip across the bars puts each terminal on its own bar.
- **Revisions and review:** released pages, approval workflow, baselines with compare
  and merge, comments and redlining.
- **Parts:** a parts database with mounting data and 3D models (STEP, IGES, Parasolid,
  JT, IFC), BMEcat, EPLAN XML and EDZ import; a parts server with a data portal that
  shows the 2D front view and the 3D model of a part; the example parts, mounting
  material included, come with both; the manufacturer catalogs of the parts server
  (ABB, Beckhoff, DEHN, Hager with NH fuse switch disconnectors and energy meters,
  MDT, Phoenix Contact, Pylontech, Siemens, Victron, Weidmüller) also feed the example
  projects. Parts are dragged from parts management or the
  data portal onto a schematic page, imported into the parts database on the way when
  needed, and placed as a device with the part. Accessories that only work with other
  parts (auxiliary and signal contacts, contact blocks) know the parts they fit from
  either side, so one accessory serves many parts (the Hager CZ001 signal contact fits
  the residual current devices CDA440D and CCA216D): the data portal and the parts
  server show both directions, the device's Parts tab, the command line and the MCP
  server offer the accessories that fit its parts, the project check reports an
  accessory without such a part, and the panel layout and the 3D view mount them
  beside or in front of their part with their own terminals. CSV, BMEcat and EPLAN XML
  carry them; the building services example signals a tripped residual current
  device through its CZ001. An accessory can also be a base the part stands on (the
  univers N component module under an NH fuse switch disconnector: the device gets
  its footprint and depth) or be built into the part (the undervoltage release and
  the auxiliary switch of a circuit breaker: their terminals are on the breaker, and
  their coils count as functions of the accessory, not as a second breaker). An
  enclosure part delivered with its plinth (`Plinth: 200`) gets it without a plinth
  part of its own. The Hager catalog adds the parts of a transformer-rated metering
  with PV: the univers cabinet FR25S2 with lifting eyes, component modules for the
  connection point zone, NH1 switches and transformers, LT153, HA354, SPA811Z, L73M,
  NBN116, MCN306, the h3+ breaker HNT161GR with motor operator, undervoltage release
  and auxiliary switch, the NA protection relay EU400, HTG911H, EZM100 and the meter
  cabinet FP62ZG2; example project 13 builds the distribution cabinet of an apartment
  building with them. Several of one base part lie side by side along the part (the
  current transformers clipped in behind the poles of an NH fuse switch disconnector
  strip). The Hager catalog adds the LVSG strips NH00 - NH3 for 185 mm busbar systems
  with the LVZW150 transformers and LVZVA-V aluminium terminals, the busbar terminal
  KS30C for Al cables, h3+ P630 HNW401DR with motor operator HXW042H, the residual
  current circuit breaker CDB640E (type B), the cabinet FR24H2 and the cable entry
  flange FZ402; new catalogs `janitza` (UMG 604-PRO) and `loxone` (energy meter for
  1 / 5 A transformers, Tree); example project 14 builds the main distribution of an
  industrial plant with them.
- **Data exchange:** PDF, DXF / DWG, SVG; the panel as glTF, STEP, IGES, IFC, JT and
  Parasolid; ERP / PDM / PLM connectors and Autodesk Vault.
- **Teams and automation:** a project server with page locks, roles and Active
  Directory / LDAP sign-in; a command line, an MCP server for AI agents and plugins.
- **Security:** the servers check the token before they read a request's body, send
  security headers with every answer, end sessions 30 days after the sign-in (sessions
  of earlier versions end at once), count failed sign-ins per name and client address
  so that nobody locks others out, and do not tell which user names exist. The data
  portal page runs only its own script: files that can run scripts (SVG, XML) are
  downloaded instead of shown and only web addresses become datasheet links. A
  manufacturer user can no longer put parts into the catalog of another manufacturer.
