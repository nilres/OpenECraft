# Plugins

OpenECraft is extended through the `openecraft-api` crate. A plugin adds

| Extension | What it is | Editor | Command line / MCP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Command | function on the project with typed parameters, returns JSON | *Plugin commands* pane (*Plugins* tab: every command by plugin with a search; favorites, recently used commands and a menu per external plugin on the tab; a form for the parameters) and the command search | a command / tool of its own |
| Check | adds issues to the project check | *Messages* pane | `check` |
| Report | table generated from the project | *Reports* pane, report pages and report blocks | `report --kind <name>` |
| Exporter | file generated from the project | *File › Export* | `export --format <name>` |

Names are snake_case and unique among all plugins; commands must not take the name of
a built-in tool. Changes a command makes to the project are one undo step.
`openecraft-cli plugins` lists the loaded plugins, *Tools › Manage plugins* in the
editor enables and disables them (remembered by the editor).

## Rust plugins

Built-in plugins live in `crates/openecraft-api/src/builtin.rs` and its submodules and
are compiled into every front end (also the web version): the project checks, reports
and exports of `openecraft-core`, project statistics, panel layout checks, panel
manufacturing, part lifecycle, and one plugin per area of project commands (pages,
sheets, drawing, devices, plugs, PLC, potentials, process engineering, single-line
diagrams, tables, engineering, electrical engineering, panel layout, rooms, 19-inch racks, routing, field
wiring, wiring, harnesses, integration, languages, structure, properties, configurator, report
blocks, project management). An area lists its commands in a `COMMANDS` table of
`Spec`s (`builtin/<area>.rs`); the command line and the MCP server offer them as tools
next to the session tools of `cli/`. The project checks themselves are registry
entries of `openecraft_core::checks` (one `Check` per area, with a snake_case name),
and the registry kinds, parameters and tables are defined in
`openecraft_core::{ext, params, table}`. A plugin implements `Plugin`:

```rust
use openecraft_api::{param, Info, Kind, Plugin, Registry, Table, Text};
use openecraft_core::issue::{Issue, Severity};
use openecraft_i18n::tr_const;

pub struct Spares;

impl Plugin for Spares {
    fn info(&self) -> Info {
        Info { id: "spares".into(), name: Text::Borrowed(tr_const!("Spare parts")), version: "1.0".into(), description: Text::Borrowed("") }
    }

    fn register(&self, reg: &mut Registry) -> Result<(), String> {
        reg.command("set_spares", tr_const!("Sets the spare quantity of a part"), vec![param("number", Kind::Str, tr_const!("Part number"))], |prj, args| {
            // change `prj`, return JSON
            Ok(serde_json::json!({ "part": args.req("number") }))
        })
        .check("spares_missing", tr_const!("Spare parts"), |prj, analysis| Ok(vec![Issue::plain(Severity::Info, "nothing missing", None)]))
        .report("spares", tr_const!("Spare parts"), |prj, analysis| Ok(Table::new([tr_const!("Part")])))
        .exporter("spares_csv", tr_const!("Spare parts (CSV)"), "csv", |prj| Ok(String::new()));
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

Texts given as `&'static str` are English catalog entries (`tr_const!`, see AGENTS.md)
and are shown translated. Issues of a check carry either a finished text
(`Issue::plain`) or, like the built-in checks, a catalog entry with its arguments
(`openecraft_core::issue!(Severity::Warning, target, "Cable {} defined {} times", tag, n)`),
which `Issue::message()` renders in the current language; the `check` tool reports the
template as `key` next to the message.

## External plugins

An external plugin is a program in any language in a folder of its own:

```
my_plugin/
  plugin.json
  main.py
```

```json
{
  "id": "my_plugin",
  "name": "My plugin",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "What it does",
  "api": 1,
  "run": ["python3", "main.py"]
}
```

The folders containing plugin folders are given in the environment variable
`OPENECRAFT_PLUGINS` (separated like `PATH`) for the editor and the command line, or
with `openecraft-cli --plugins <folder>`. External plugins need processes and are not
available in the browser.

### Protocol

For every request OpenECraft starts the program (`run`, in the plugin folder), writes
one JSON object to its stdin and reads one JSON object from its stdout, both in UTF-8
(Python is started with `PYTHONUTF8=1` and `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8`; where `python3` is
not installed, as on Windows, `python` is started instead). Every request
has `"api": 1` and a `method`. An answer `{"error": "message"}` (or a non-zero exit
code, with the message on stderr) is an error. `project` is the project as in a
`.oec` file. A program that has not answered after 5 minutes is stopped and the request
fails. Plugins run with the rights of the user: load only plugin folders you trust.

| Request | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| `{"method": "describe"}` | `{"commands": [{"name", "help", "params": [{"name", "kind", "required", "help"}]}], "checks": [{"name", "title"}], "reports": [{"name", "title"}], "exporters": [{"name", "title", "extension", "params"}]}` (all lists optional, `params` of exporters too) |
| `{"method": "command", "name", "params": {…}, "project": {…}}` | `{"result": <any JSON>, "project": {…}}` – `project` only if the command changed it |
| `{"method": "check", "name", "project"}` | `{"issues": [{"severity": "error" \| "warning" \| "info", "message", "page": <page index>, "item": <item id>}]}` – `page` / `item` optional; `page` alone points at the page, a page the project does not have at nothing |
| `{"method": "report", "name", "project"}` | `{"headers": ["…"], "rows": [["…"]]}` |
| `{"method": "export", "name", "params": {…}, "project"}` | `{"content": "file content"}` (text; `params` holds what the front end passed: by convention `page`, the name of one page, and `file`, the file name) |

Parameter kinds: `str`, `int`, `num`, `bool`, `ids` (list of item ids), `points`
(list of `[x, y]` in mm), `object` (JSON object). `required` defaults to `true`.

A command that answers with an error leaves the project unchanged, also in the editor
and the MCP server.

`describe` is asked once when the plugin is loaded; checks run after every change of
the project in the editor, so they should answer quickly. The project's check settings
apply to the issues of plugins as well: a check can be switched off by its name, and
its plain messages share the check's name as code (level changes then apply to all of
them) and can be accepted one by one.

A complete example is in [`examples/plugins/page_notes`](../examples/plugins/page_notes).

### EPLAN window macros

The drawing plugin accepts PXF window macro XML with `import_ema` (parameter `xml`). Its result lists native symbol definitions, function types, variant IDs, multi-device macros, and unresolved references. Reimport preserves locally edited definitions. The `place_part` command accepts an optional `variant` symbol key. The CLI and MCP file tool `import_eplan_symbols` reads an EMA, an EDZ, a companion article XML, or a vendor folder with a selected part number.
