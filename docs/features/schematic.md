# Schematic editor

Pages, devices and their structure, live cross references, editing tools, navigators and project storage. The [user interface](../user-interface.md) lists the commands and keys.

## Projects with pages

Multi-line schematic pages (A3, 10 columns / 6 rows, title block),
cover sheet and generated report pages. Page navigator with reordering.

## Device-oriented engineering

Device tags (`-K1`, `-S3`, …) are assigned automatically.
Main function (coil) + auxiliary functions (contacts) form one device. Select a coil and
place contacts: they are assigned to it and numbered (13/14, 21/22, …).

## Device boxes and device connection points

Power supplies, measuring instruments and control modules without a library symbol:
*Insert › Device box* draws a dashed box of any size as a new device (`-A1`, with its
function text and parts like any other device), *Insert › Device connection point*
places its connections one click after the other. A point placed on the outline of a
box belongs to the box's device, leads away from the edge it is on and is numbered on
(1, 2, 3 …; `13` is followed by `14`); its designation (`L`, `N`, `PE`, `+24V`, …) is
edited in its properties. Each point is a connection of its own, distinct from
terminals: two points of a box are never connected by the box, they appear as
`-A1:L`, `-A1:N` in the connection and device connection reports, and the check reports
a designation used twice on one device. The properties of a point name its device box
(another box assigns it to that device); a point away from its box shows its device
tag, on its box the box shows it. Its designation can be dragged to any place and
aligned left, centred or right. The properties of a box set its width and height:
points on an edge that moves go with it, their wires follow. Moving, turning, copying,
cutting, deleting and saving as a macro take a box with its points; copies become a
new device with their own points. Commands: `add_device_box`, `update_device_box`,
`add_device_connections` (several at a distance, designations given or numbered on),
`update_device_connection`, `list_device_boxes`.

A box can also continue a device placed elsewhere: give it the device's tag and choose
its *Role* in the properties (`role` of `add_device_box` and `update_device_box`). An
*Extension* adds connection points to the device, for a device too large for one box or
a library symbol that lacks some connections. Its points are new connections, and a
designation the device already has is reported as used twice. A *Pin view* shows some
connection points the device already has, for example only the supply of a PLC card on
the power page; tick them in the properties (`show_device_pins`) or place points with
their designations. A point on a view is the connection point it shows: wires drawn
there belong to that point's potential on every page, reports list the connection once,
from the device's own point, and the check reports a view of a point the device does
not have. Neither role is a second main function. The box shows a cross reference to
the device, and the device's main function to its boxes; copied without the device,
these boxes stay on it. A box with a role but no device placed is reported.

## Structure identifiers (IEC 81346)

Pages carry a function (`=A1`) and a location
(`+CAB1`). Devices placed on a page get its structure (`=A1+CAB1-K1`); on the page, tags
and cross references show only what differs from the page structure (EPLAN style),
tags are numbered per structure, copy / paste moves devices into the target structure,
changing a page structure can move its devices along. The device navigator groups by
structure; the title block shows the full page name (`=A1+CAB1/3`).

**Structure boxes** (*Insert › Structure box*) give an area of a page its own function,
location (or installation site, product): draw a rectangle and set the aspects it
overrides in the properties; empty aspects are inherited from the page or an enclosing
box, nested boxes resolve to the innermost. A device belongs to the box its main
function's insertion point lies in: it gets the box's structure (`=SYS+FIELD-S1` on a
page `=SYS+CAB1`), its tag on the page omits what the box shows, and its full tag is
what the navigator, numbering, cross references and reports use. An aspect of a tag
equal to the structure around the symbol is inherited, any other is the device's own:
moving the main function into or out of a box, or moving, resizing, changing or
deleting the box, renames the device (all its functions) in its inherited aspects in
the same undo step and keeps its own; a tag that exists already is refused and reported
instead of merging two devices. The symbol properties show where each aspect comes
from. Boxes are copied, pasted and saved in macros with their devices; the check
*Structure identifiers* reports boxes that overlap without one lying inside the other, and
devices inside a box whose tag has another value for an aspect the box sets.
Commands `add_structure_box`, `update_structure_box`, `list_structure_boxes`.

## Live cross references

Contacts show where their coil is (`/3.4`), coils show a
contact image with all contacts and their locations, interruption points reference their
counterparts on other pages. *Connections › Cross references…* sets the format (prefix,
separator, row: `/3.4`, `3-4`, `/3.4.B`), when the structure of the target page is
shown (when it differs, always, never), what interruption points refer to (all
other points, star from the first point, or pairs in schematic order; the check
reports a point without partner) and whether coils draw a contact image. Command:
`set_cross_references`.

The name and the cross reference of an interruption point follow the arrow: for
horizontal points the name above and the cross reference below the conductor, ending at
the connection point, so that they stay inside the page at its edge; for vertical points
beside the arrow (cross reference below the name). *Display* in the properties puts
them above, below, left or right of the arrow instead, for all selected points at once
(right of a right arrow: in one line after its tip, for conductors 4 mm apart); with one point
selected, each text can be dragged on its own without moving the symbol, and the
reset button returns to the automatic placement. The places are saved with the project
and used by the PDF, SVG and DXF exports; the cross reference stays a link to its page.
Command: `place_interruption_texts`.

## Connectivity / potentials

Wires, T-junctions (with connection dots), terminals,
potential connection points (L1, N, PE, +24V, …) and interruption points are evaluated
into nets across pages. Selecting a wire highlights its whole potential.

## Editing

Select / window select / move with wires that follow and stay square, rotate, mirror,
copy / cut / paste (via clipboard, devices get new tags), undo / redo, texts, grid
snapping, pan and zoom. A wire attached to something that moves keeps its direction:
a corner or a junction at its far end slides along the wire there (a junction on a
rail stays on the rail), otherwise the wire gets a jog or a route around what is in
the way, and a wire that cannot be squared without touching another connection stays
diagonal. Connection definition points and cable definition lines stay on their
wires unless they are moved themselves; a line that cannot stay across exactly its
wires stays where it is. With *Route the connections of moved items anew*
(*Connections › Wire crossings…*, off by default) such a wire is routed again
together with the corners after it, up to the next connection point, junction or
branch, on the way of the least weight: its length in grid steps, 1.2 per bend and
1.5 per wire crossed; a connection without such a way is squared as before. Editing aids: grid sizes 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 mm (View); a
coordinate field in the tool bar (`x y` absolute or `@dx dy` relative to the last
point, Enter acts like a click of the current tool); *Home › Align* (edges or
centres), *Distribute* (evenly, horizontally or vertically), *Move selection by…*
and *Multiple copy…* (n copies at a fixed distance, new tags and terminal numbers);
attached wire ends follow. Commands: `align_items`, `distribute_items`, `copy_items`.

## Texts

Free texts with rotation (0 … 359°, e.g. reading upwards along a terminal
strip), left / centred / right alignment, a vertical anchor, word wrap at a set
width, bold / italic / underline, a border and an opaque background, and a hyperlink
(Ctrl + click opens it; clickable in the PDF and SVG export). **Special texts** show
project and page properties anywhere on a page: placeholders such as `{page}`,
`{project}` or `{prop:Name}` (the same as in title blocks, Insert › Special text) are
filled in when the page is drawn. A **path function text** (Insert › Path function
text) is the function text of all functions in its column that have none of their
own; the device list, terminal, plug and PLC diagrams use it. Texts turn with a
rotated selection; DXF / DWG import keeps text rotation and alignment. Command line /
MCP: `add_text`, `update_text`.

## Schematic graphics

Lines, rectangles, circles, ellipses, arcs, polylines and
polygons (width, colour, dashed, filled), dimensions (aligned / horizontal / vertical,
scale, unit), PNG / JPEG images (also in the PDF and SVG export). **Layers**
(navigator › Layers): visible, locked, printed, colour; DXF / DWG export per layer.

## Wire crossings and T-connections

Wires that cross without a connection are drawn as a plain crossing, or the vertical
(or horizontal) wire jumps over the other with an **arc**, a square **bridge** or a
**gap**; close jumps on a wire become one. T-connections show a **dot**, a **large
dot** or **no dot** (a plain T); a connection of four or more wires always keeps its
dot, so that it never looks like a crossing. *Connections › Wire crossings…* sets
both with a preview; the setting is saved with the project and in settings schemes
and applies to the canvas and the PDF, SVG and DXF export alike. Command line / MCP:
`wire_settings` (`jump`: none, arc, bridge, gap; `jump_wire`: vertical, horizontal;
`tee`: dot, large_dot, none; `reroute`).

## Routing

Auto-connect draws wires between facing free connection points when
symbols are placed or moved; the wire tool can route around symbols and other wires
(A); collinear wire pieces can be joined. Also as `route` / `autoconnect` commands.

## Property placement

Drag the tag block of a selected symbol; place further device
properties (description, part / type number, manufacturer, designation, connection
points, structure) beside it.

Connection point designations are placed beside the lead of their connection point,
moved along it, to its other side or out beside the wire where the symbol's graphics,
wires, nearby symbols or the symbol's other texts are in the way. Drag one of a
selected symbol to place it by hand, or choose left, right, above or below for each
in *Property placement*; *Reset* returns it to automatic placement. The placement
turns and mirrors with the symbol and never moves the connection point. Command:
`place_pin_label`. The designation of a symbol with a single connection point (such as a
device connection point) is dragged freely and keeps its alignment.

Placed automatically, the tag block sits left of a vertical symbol and above a
horizontal one. Where it would run into a neighbouring symbol there, it goes on the
other side, above or below, whichever is first clear of symbols and wires with all its
lines, the cross references included. The tag of
a function right beside one of the same device in the same row (such as surge
arresters drawn pole by pole) is shown once, at the first of them, like the strip tag
of a row of terminals. A tag block placed by hand stays where it is.

## Find

**Find** (*Home › Find…*, `Ctrl+F`): searches the whole project (page names and
descriptions, device tags, function texts, free texts, wire numbers, terminals and
pins, cables, part numbers, descriptions) with case and whole-word options, jumps
to the hits and replaces text in free texts, function texts and descriptions
(released pages stay). Commands: `find`, `replace_text`.

## Navigators

Pages (optionally grouped by structure with the descriptions of the
structure management), devices (select on page, place further functions, rename),
connections (filter, show, select, add a connection definition), cables (cores in
use and free, cable definitions, draw a cable definition), layers and the check.
The *Unplaced* tab lists what the project data has but the schematic does not: the
channels of PLC cards with a device description that have no input / output symbol
(with their address), and the functions of the assigned parts that no symbol uses
(coils, contacts with their designations), and the potentials defined in the project
that no potential connection point carries yet; drag one into the page (or click it, then
into the page) to place it with tag, address and designations. Command:
`list_unplaced`.

## Languages

English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese (Brazil), Italian, Dutch,
Polish, Czech, Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish, Swedish, Danish, Finnish, Hungarian, Romanian,
Chinese (Simplified), Japanese and Korean (*View › Language*; the editor and the parts
manager remember the choice and start in the system / browser language if supported).
Chinese, Japanese and Korean come with bundled fonts (subsets of Noto Sans SC / JP / KR);
project texts in these scripts also use the system's CJK fonts on the desktop, on screen
and in PDF exports (embedded as a subset).

## Project texts in several languages

Function texts, page descriptions, free
texts and descriptions are written in a source language; the project's translation
dictionary (*Project data › Project languages…*) translates them line by line into any
number of target languages, with CSV export / import for translators and a check
for untranslated texts. *Project data › Export as PDF in language* (command line: `export`
with `language`) puts out the documentation per language – project texts from the
dictionary, reports and title blocks in that language (English, German, French,
Spanish; other languages get English report headings).

## Project templates

**Project templates** (in the spirit of EPLAN's basic projects): *File › New › New project
from template* starts from a built-in template (empty IEC 60204-1 project; machine
with cover sheet, table of contents, structured schematic pages and report pages;
distribution board with single-line overview, climate and short-circuit reports) or
from any project file; *Save as project template…* writes the current project
without revisions, baselines, review, wiring marks and accepted check messages.
Command line: `new_project --template Machine` (or a file); `new_project --example
<name>` starts from an [example project](../../README.md#example-projects).

## Storage

JSON project files (`.oec`); the current project and the parts
database are also auto-saved (compressed) in the app's data folder on the desktop and
in IndexedDB in the browser, whose local storage holds only about 5 MB (until the
first write to IndexedDB succeeds they are kept in local storage as well).
