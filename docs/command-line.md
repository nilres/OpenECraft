# Command line, MCP server and plugins

Projects and the parts server without a window, for scripts and AI agents.

`openecraft-cli` edits projects and maintains the parts server without a window. The same
commands are offered to AI agents over the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
(`openecraft-cli mcp`, JSON-RPC on stdin / stdout), so an agent can create projects, place
symbols, draw wires between connection points, assign parts, run the check, generate
reports and export PDF / SVG / DXF / DWG.

```bash
cargo run --release -p openecraft-cli -- help                 # all commands
cargo run --release -p openecraft-cli -- help connect         # parameters of a command
cargo run --release -p openecraft-cli -- --version             # also -V or version
openecraft-cli new_project --name "Pump control" --path pump.oec
openecraft-cli new_project --example star_delta_starter --path star_delta.oec   # see list_examples
openecraft-cli -p pump.oec place_symbol --page 1 --symbol pb_no --x 200 --y 100   # -S1
openecraft-cli -p pump.oec place_symbol --page 1 --symbol coil --x 200 --y 160    # -K1
openecraft-cli -p pump.oec place_part --page 1 --part GEN.LMP-GN-24 --x 240 --y 160   # -P1 with its part
openecraft-cli -p pump.oec connect --page 1 --from -S1:14 --to -K1:A1
openecraft-cli -p pump.oec check
openecraft-cli -p pump.oec export --format pdf --path pump.pdf
openecraft-cli --server http://127.0.0.1:8090 --token <secret> parts_import --path parts.csv
openecraft-cli --server http://127.0.0.1:8090 --token <secret> parts_import --path 6ED1052-1CC08-0BA3.edz
openecraft-cli --project drawing.oec import_eplan_symbols --path drive.edz
openecraft-cli --project drawing.oec import_eplan_symbols --path Beckhoff --part BEC.EK1100
```

- On the command line every change is written back to `--project` at once. In an MCP
  session the project stays open in memory: `save_project` writes it, `undo` / `redo`
  revert single tool calls (`help mcp`); the command line refuses `undo` / `redo`, as it
  opens the project anew for every command. An archive given as `--project` stays
  unchanged: save the project as a project file (`save_project --path <file>.oec`) or
  convert the archive (`convert_project`).
- Parameters are `--name value` (also `--name=value`, or all at once with `--json '{…}'`);
  lists as `--ids 3,4` and points as `--points "0,0 40,0"`; lists of codes, tags or
  languages are separated by commas or blanks. Values outside their range are refused
  with the allowed range, not clamped, and a command that fails leaves the project
  unchanged. Numbers in answers are rounded to the precision they are stored with.
- Parameters renamed since earlier versions are still taken under their old names:
  `rename_device` `old` / `new` (now `tag` / `new_tag`), `rename` of `set_potential`,
  `set_fluid_group` and `set_pct_loop` (now `new_name`), `replace_text` `text` / `with`
  (now `find` / `replace`).
- Parts server: `--server` / `--token`, the `OPENECRAFT_SERVER` / `OPENECRAFT_TOKEN`
  environment variables or the `parts_connect` tool (also with `user` / `password`);
  default `http://127.0.0.1:8090`. `parts_connect` with `kind: Eplan` reads the EPLAN
  Data Portal instead (the token is the personal access token; searching, `parts_get`,
  `parts_file` and `parts_check_updates` only). The data portal tools search with facets
  (`parts_search`), manage catalogs, files, favorites and users (`parts_catalog_save`,
  `parts_attach`, `parts_favorites`, `parts_user_save`, …), compare the project parts
  with the server (`parts_check_updates`) and share the company's forms
  (`parts_company_forms` (`publish`)).
- Help and messages follow `--lang` or the system language; the MCP server answers in
  English unless `--lang` is given.

- `OPENECRAFT_MCP_ROOT` is the folder the files of the MCP tools must be in (`path`,
  `output`, `folder`, `database`, `target` and template files); default the working
  folder of the server, `*` allows every folder. An agent misled by text it reads (a
  project, a part, a web page) cannot read or overwrite files elsewhere, such as other
  projects or plugin folders.
- `OPENECRAFT_MCP_TOOLS` limits the tools the MCP server offers, for clients that take
  only a limited number: names separated by commas, `parts_*` for all tools starting
  with `parts_` (e.g. `new_project,open_project,save_project,place_symbol,connect,check,export`).
- `new_project --path` does not replace an existing file unless `overwrite` is given.
  `search_projects` searches the current folder unless a database or folder is given.

Register the MCP server with an agent, e.g. Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add openecraft -- /path/to/openecraft-cli mcp
```

or in the `mcpServers` configuration of other clients:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "openecraft": { "command": "openecraft-cli", "args": ["mcp"] } } }
```

The agent can read and write any file the server process can access; start it in a
working directory (and with a parts server token) you are fine with the agent using.

## Plugins

Plugins add commands, checks, reports and exports to the editor (*Plugins* tab: *Plugin
commands* lists every command by plugin with a search, the star pins one to the tab; *Check*
tab), the command line and the MCP server at the same time. Built-in plugins are Rust
code in `crates/openecraft-api`; external plugins are programs in any language that
answer JSON requests on stdin / stdout:

```bash
OPENECRAFT_PLUGINS=examples/plugins openecraft-cli -p pump.oec plugins
openecraft-cli --plugins examples/plugins -p pump.oec report --kind page_notes
```

See [docs/plugins.md](plugins.md) for the API and the protocol.
