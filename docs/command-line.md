# Command line, MCP server and plugins

Projects and the parts server without a window, for scripts and AI agents.

`openecraft-cli` edits projects and maintains the parts server without a window. The same
commands are offered to AI agents over the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
(`openecraft-cli mcp`, JSON-RPC on stdin / stdout), so an agent can create projects, place
symbols, draw wires between connection points, assign parts, run the check, generate
reports and export PDF / SVG / DXF / DWG.

```bash
cargo run --release -p openecraft-cli -- help                 # all commands
cargo run --release -p openecraft-cli -- help connect         # parameters of a command
cargo run --release -p openecraft-cli -- --version             # also -V or version
openecraft-cli new_project --name "Pump control" --path pump.oec

- On the command line every change is written back to `--project` at once. In an MCP
  session the project stays open in memory: `save_project` writes it, `undo` / `redo`
  revert single tool calls (`help mcp`); the command line refuses `undo` / `redo`, as it
  opens the project anew for every command. An archive given as `--project` stays
  unchanged: save the project as a project file (`save_project --path <file>.oec`) or
  convert the archive (`convert_project`).
- A **split project** keeps the project as many small files for version control (git):
  the index `<name>.oecp` with a folder `pages` (one file per page), `data` (one file
  per device, part, cable … and per area of the project-wide data; the files of a kind
  are spread over 16 folders, so that none grows too large) and `files` (embedded
  documents and images as plain files) next to it. It holds the same project as the
  `.oec` file: `convert_project --path plant.oec --format oecp` writes
  `plant/plant.oecp`, `--format oec` or `--format oecz` convert back, and `--project
  plant/plant.oecp` works on it like on a project file – a change rewrites only the
  files it concerns. Every file is one line of JSON and depends only on the content of
  the project, so saving an unchanged project changes nothing. A split project needs a
  folder of its own; other files in it (a README, `.gitattributes`) are left alone. A
  folder that has no index but already holds JSON files in `pages`, `data` or `files`
  is refused: they are someone else's and would be replaced or removed.
- Saving a large split project costs what changed, not what the project holds: only
  the pages and data that differ from the last save are written (a project of 500
  pages and 20 000 devices saves a changed page in well under a second). A save is
  one step: the changed files are written next to the old ones, a journal
  (`.oecp-save`) names them, and only then they take their places; after a crash the
  project is as it was before the save, or the next access finishes it.
- **Git** needs two things for a split project. The `.gitattributes` that saving writes
  into the folder (unless there is one) keeps git from converting line ends, which
  would change every file and damage the embedded ones; a `.gitignore` written with it
  leaves out the journal and the temporary files of a save in progress. And the merge driver merges
  the JSON files record by record, so that changes to different symbols of a page, or
  to different fields of one, do not conflict; set it up once per clone:

  ```bash
  git config merge.openecraft.name "OpenECraft split project"
  git config merge.openecraft.driver "openecraft-cli merge_project_file --base %O --ours %A --theirs %B --name %P"
  ```

  Where both sides changed the same value, the file keeps the value of the current
  branch, the command names the places and git marks the file as conflicted: open the
  project, set what is right and `git add` the file. Without the driver git merges
  the files as text and writes both versions into them; such a file is named when the
  project is opened: take one version (`git checkout --ours` or `--theirs`) and set
  up the driver.
- **Ids of new objects.** Every copy of a split project starts the ids of its new
  objects at a random place above the ids in use, so that two people who add objects
  on their branches do not give them the same ids (ids therefore grow in steps, by up
  to 67 million per editing session that adds objects). This is a safeguard with
  limits, not a guarantee:
  - The chance of about 1 in 30 000 for two copies edited at the same time holds while
    each adds fewer than 1 024 objects. A session that imports a large macro or copies
    many pages spans many of the places ids start at: two copies that each add about
    50 000 objects meet roughly 1 time in 650.
  - `openecraft-cli -p plant/plant.oecp check_project_data` reports ids used more than
    once and `--repair` renumbers them: run it after a merge. A reference to such an id
    (a connection to an object) cannot tell which of the two objects it meant and may
    end up on the wrong one, so look at what the repair names.
  - Only the session that edits a project starts its ids anew; reading one (the
    comparison, a template, the project database) does not, and a project made from a
    template counts on.
- **Changes of another program while the project is open** (a `git pull`, a second
  editor): saving writes only the files this side changed and keeps the others; the
  editor and an MCP session then read the project again, so that it shows both. A
  file changed on both sides is not overwritten: the save fails and names the files.
  Save under another name, or open the project again and repeat the changes. The
  editor keeps the undo steps (undo does not take back what the other program
  changed) and remembers the files between runs, so a pull made while it was closed
  is treated the same way.
- Parameters are `--name value` (also `--name=value`, or all at once with `--json '{…}'`);
  lists as `--ids 3,4` and points as `--points "0,0 40,0"`; lists of codes, tags or
  languages are separated by commas or blanks. Values outside their range are refused
  with the allowed range, not clamped, and a command that fails leaves the project
  unchanged. Numbers in answers are rounded to the precision they are stored with.
- Parameters renamed since earlier versions are still taken under their old names:
  `rename_device` `old` / `new` (now `tag` / `new_tag`), `rename` of `set_potential`,
  `set_fluid_group` and `set_pct_loop` (now `new_name`), `replace_text` `text` / `with`
  (now `find` / `replace`).
- Parts server: `--server` / `--token`, the `OPENECRAFT_SERVER` / `OPENECRAFT_TOKEN`
  environment variables or the `parts_connect` tool (also with `user` / `password`);
  default `http://127.0.0.1:8090`. `parts_connect` with `kind: Eplan` reads the EPLAN
  Data Portal instead (the token is the personal access token; searching, `parts_get`,
  `parts_file` and `parts_check_updates` only). The data portal tools search with facets
  (`parts_search`), manage catalogs, files, favorites and users (`parts_catalog_save`,
  `parts_attach`, `parts_favorites`, `parts_user_save`, …), compare the project parts
  with the server (`parts_check_updates`) and share the company's forms
  (`parts_company_forms` (`publish`)).
- Help and messages follow `--lang` or the system language; the MCP server answers in
  English unless `--lang` is given.

- `OPENECRAFT_MCP_ROOT` is the folder the files of the MCP tools must be in (`path`,
  `output`, `folder`, `database`, `target` and template files); default the working
  folder of the server, `*` allows every folder. An agent misled by text it reads (a
  project, a part, a web page) cannot read or overwrite files elsewhere, such as other
  projects or plugin folders.
- `OPENECRAFT_MCP_TOOLS` limits the tools the MCP server offers, for clients that take
  only a limited number: names separated by commas, `parts_*` for all tools starting
  with `parts_` (e.g. `new_project,open_project,save_project,place_symbol,connect,check,export`).
- `new_project --path` does not replace an existing file unless `overwrite` is given.
  `search_projects` searches the current folder unless a database or folder is given.

Register the MCP server with an agent, e.g. Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add openecraft -- /path/to/openecraft-cli mcp
```

or in the `mcpServers` configuration of other clients:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "openecraft": { "command": "openecraft-cli", "args": ["mcp"] } } }
```

The agent can read and write any file the server process can access; start it in a
working directory (and with a parts server token) you are fine with the agent using.

## Plugins

Plugins add commands, checks, reports and exports to the editor (*Plugins* tab: *Plugin
commands* lists every command by plugin with a search, the star pins one to the tab; *Check*
tab), the command line and the MCP server at the same time. Built-in plugins are Rust
code in `crates/openecraft-api`; external plugins are programs in any language that
answer JSON requests on stdin / stdout:

```bash
OPENECRAFT_PLUGINS=examples/plugins openecraft-cli -p pump.oec plugins
openecraft-cli --plugins examples/plugins -p pump.oec report --kind page_notes
```

See [docs/plugins.md](plugins.md) for the API and the protocol.
