# Architecture

How the crates fit together, where a new feature goes, and which rules are enforced
by tests. The analysis that led to the current structure, with the refactoring plan,
is in [architecture-analysis.md](architecture-analysis.md).

```

- Library crates live under `crates/`; executables are `openecraft/` (editor),
  `cli/`, `parts-server/`, `project-server/`, `parts-manager/`.
- A crate depends only on crates to its left. No library depends on an executable.
  `openecraft-api` has no UI dependency and no `cfg(target_arch)` branch.
- Platform code (`wasm32` versus native) exists only in `crates/openecraft-ui/src/io.rs`
  and the `main.rs` files.
- Protocol types sit beside the logic that both sides share: parts server API in
  `openecraft_parts::api` / `portal`, project server API and merge rules in
  `openecraft_core::collab`, roles, grants and their evaluation for both servers in
  `openecraft_parts::access` (the servers check, the clients offer what is allowed).
- `openecraft-auth` is native only and used by the servers alone: password hashes,
  session tokens, sign-in with directories (Active Directory, LDAP), the access
  settings file and reading the configuration files of the servers (`--config`,
  `server_config`). See [access-control.md](access-control.md).
- Autodesk Vault is a server of another vendor: its requests, answer types and the
  operations of several requests (`Job`: uploads with checkout and check-in, the item
  lookup) live in `openecraft_client::vault`. The editor (`openecraft/src/vault.rs`) runs
  the jobs in the background, the command line (`cli/src/vault.rs`) blocking; item
  links reach the project through the PLM connector of `openecraft_core::integration`.

## Layers inside `openecraft-core`

The crate is one compilation unit, so the compiler does not stop a module from
reaching upwards. `openecraft/src/conventions/tests.rs` (`core_modules_respect_the_layer_rules`)
does: `CORE_RULES` lists every module with the modules it may refer to (`crate::…`
paths outside comments). The table pins the current graph: a new edge fails the test,
removing an edge means shortening a list. Entries that point upwards are the known
exceptions, to be removed over time.

Layers, bottom up (a module may use its own layer and the layers below):

1. Foundations without dependencies: `geom`, `xml`, `zip`, `xlsx` (Excel workbooks),
   `ttf` (TrueType reader and
   subsetter for PDF fonts), `params` (typed parameters and
   `Text`), `table` (report tables), `parallel` (work spread over the threads), `issue` (`Issue`, `Severity`; a built-in check's
   message is an English template with its arguments, `issue!(severity, target, "…",
   args)`, translated by `Issue::message()` where it is shown, so that the analysis
   survives a language change and MCP clients get a stable `key`; plugin and generated
   texts are `Issue::plain`).
2. `symbols`, `symlib`: symbol definitions. The 2D PXF decoder lives in
   `symlib::ema`. The macro module uses its device definitions to construct
   native multi-device window macros. Macro resolution also visits primitive text
   and literal attribute-block rows in these lower-layer definitions. The built-in library is static
   (`symbols::builtin`); the user symbols of a project are resolved through
   `Project::symbol` / `Project::symbol_table()` (`symlib::Symbols`, a snapshot the
   editing functions take as a parameter), never through process-wide state.
3. `model` with its data submodules (`model/panel.rs`, `model/forms.rs`, …): the
   project file format. Data only, serde, no evaluation. The feature modules re-export
   their data types from here and keep the logic.
4. Evaluation of the model that everything else builds on: `index`, `references` (live function and discipline links), `netlist` (with
   `netlist::junctions`, the target tracing of directed T-junctions),
   `structure`, `sections` (page sections: tree, numbers in the page names), `frame`, `wirenum`, `history`, `translation`, `options`,
   `potentials`, `functions`, `properties`, `props`, `numbering` (device and page
   renumbering), `text` (free texts: lines,
   wrapping, rotation, path function texts).
5. Feature logic and page editing: `ops`, `routing` (schematic wires: routes, wires that follow a move), `arrange` (align, distribute, multiple copy), `device_boxes` (freely drawn device boxes and their device connection points; `ops` uses it for new points), `panel`, `electrical`, `fluid`, `plc`,
   `plc_hw`, `field`, `routing3d`, `strips`, `plugs`, `pinout` (connector faces, flat cables), `harness`, `marking`, `forms`,
   `report_blocks`, `revision`, `review`, `compare`, …
6. Derived data and the registry: `analysis` (`Analysis`: index, netlists,
   connections, wire ends, panel wiring, routing, field plan, report tables on demand), `checks`
   (the built-in checks as `Check` entries), `reports` (the built-in tables as `Report`
   entries), `exporters` (the built-in exports as `Exporter` entries), `ext` (the
   registry kinds).
7. Output and exchange formats: `render`, `svg`, `pdf`, `dxf`, `dxf_import`, `dwg`,
   `export3d`, `aml`, `integration`, `kbl` (harness data as KBL / VDA 4964),
   `harness_export` (harness interface: JSON, wire processing list, 3D bundle).
8. Project files, sharing, verification: `archive`, `collab`, `projects`, `verify`,
   `sample`.

Known upward edges (listed in `CORE_RULES`, to be removed): `structure`, `macros`,
`page_templates` and `document` use `ops`; `field`, `document` and `review` draw with
`render` (and `field` with `svg`); `production` writes DXF; `panel` uses `analysis`
(routed wiring), `plc_hw` uses `ops`; `model` and `symlib` refer to each other
(`Project` carries the `symlib::SymbolCache` of its user symbols). `analysis` and `ext`
refer to each other (the registry kinds take an `&Analysis`).

## The editor

- `openecraft/src/session.rs` holds the document state: the open project, its undo
  history, the analysis (rebuilt after committed changes and language changes, with the
  reports and checks of the registry), the device index, the saved revision and the
  file name. It has no UI code and is unit tested; `App` adds the windows. The
  analysis is incremental: `analysis::Cache` keeps the netlist scan of every page
  (`netlist::Scans`, keyed by page id and a fingerprint of its wires and symbols), so
  a change scans only the changed pages again; the checks run on several threads where
  the platform has them (`analysis::par_map`, sequential in the browser).
- `openecraft/src/autosave.rs` keeps the autosaved project and parts database in the
  app's `openecraft_ui::io::Store` (a file per key on the desktop, IndexedDB in the
  browser) and decides when a value read back at start-up may replace the start-up
  one; once the store works, it packs and writes on another thread.
- `openecraft/src/jobs.rs` runs work that would hold up the window on another thread
  (exports with an analysis of their own from `Session::snapshot`, reading model and
  parts files); `App` applies the results when they are there. After an edit that
  changes routes the session searches the 3D routing on another thread as well
  (`Analysis::build_kept`, `routes_pending`). Without threads (the browser) the work
  is done at once.
- `openecraft/src/updater.rs` updates the installed editor from the GitHub releases on a
  thread of its own (`openecraft_client::update`: the latest release, versions, the file
  of an installation, the check against `SHA256SUMS`); `App` only shows its state
  (`app/update_ui.rs`). Nothing in the window waits for the network.
- The shell (see `docs/ux-workplan.md`) is described by four modules without UI code,
  each unit tested: `openecraft/src/commands.rs` is the table of every command of the
  editor (id, title, tooltip, icon, kind, default keys, the pane it shows);
  `openecraft/src/ribbon.rs` places the commands in the tabs and groups of the ribbon,
  the backstage pages and the quick access row, assigns key tips and holds the user's
  customisation; `openecraft/src/dock.rs` lists the panes (page, navigators, Insert
  center, properties, panel layout and wiring panes, and every tool as a `ToolPane`)
  with the default arrangement of each workspace (`egui_tiles`, one tree per
  workspace); `openecraft/src/workspaces.rs` the built-in and saved workspaces.
  `openecraft/src/insert_center.rs` holds the search, favorites and recently used
  entries of the Insert center, `openecraft/src/shortcuts.rs` the keys of every command,
  `openecraft/src/style.rs` the state colours (light and dark, tested for contrast).
  The tests check that every command has a place in the shell and every pane a
  command, so a new feature cannot be unreachable. Icons are vector paths in
  `openecraft_ui::icons`.
- `openecraft/src/app.rs` is the composition root: the `App` struct, start-up, the frame
  loop and the handful of helpers every pane needs (`notify`, `goto`, `show_pane`,
  `set_workspace`, `replace_project`, `add_page`). The ribbon and quick access row
  (`app/ribbon_ui.rs`), the backstage (`app/backstage.rs`), the status bar, the command
  search, the settings dialog, the start page, the help pane, the Insert center and
  the running of commands (`app/commands_ui.rs`) are `impl App` blocks in modules of
  their own; `app/dock_ui.rs` draws the panes, the page tabs and the panes floating
  as windows (tools open floating unless the user docked them: `dock::Placement`). Each tool is a pane function (`fn …_pane(&mut self, ui)`) in its module
  under `app/` with a state struct; its `open` flag asks for the pane to be shown.
  Small one-shot dialogs (rename, move by, save as macro, part selection, export
  parameters) stay windows (`app/windows.rs`).
- Rules that change the project (page order, deleting pages, renaming devices) live
  in `openecraft_core::ops`, so the command line and the MCP server share them.
- The editor names core modules as `openecraft_core::…`; `main.rs` re-exports
  nothing (checked by `conventions/tests.rs`).

## Where a new feature goes

1. Data that is stored in the project: a type in the model layer, a field of
   `Project` (with `#[serde(skip_serializing_if)]` for empty values), a conversion
   step in `archive::convert` if an existing field changes meaning.
2. Logic: a module in the feature layer with its tests in `<module>/tests.rs`.
3. Checks, reports, exports, commands: registry entries (`openecraft_api::Registry`,
   see `docs/plugins.md`), so that the editor, the command line and the MCP server
   offer them at once. A built-in check goes into `openecraft_core::checks::builtin`,
   a built-in report into `reports::builtin` (one `ReportKind` with a name and title
   key), a built-in export into `exporters::builtin`; the built-in plugins of
   `openecraft-api` publish these lists. A command on the project is an entry of the
   `COMMANDS` table of its area in `crates/openecraft-api/src/builtin/<area>.rs`
   (`fn(&mut Project, &Args) -> Result<Value, String>`, tested through the
   `builtin::testing` session). Only tools that need the session or the machine
   (project files, undo, exports to files, the parts server) stay `Tool`s in
   `cli/src/tools/`. Front ends never special-case one of them: they enumerate
   `Plugins`.
4. UI: a module under `openecraft/src/app/` that draws and sends actions; rules that
   change the project go to core (`ops` or the feature module) so the command line can
   use them. A new tool is a pane: a `ToolPane` variant, a command in
   `openecraft/src/commands.rs` that shows it and a place in a group of
   `openecraft/src/ribbon.rs` (the tests fail otherwise).
5. Texts: English in the code, through `tr` / `tr_fmt!` / `tr_const!`, with catalog
   entries in the four required languages and, where possible, the further ones (see
   AGENTS.md).

## Decisions

- **Formatting (2026-10-24).** The sources are not in rustfmt's shape: `cargo fmt
  --check` with `max_width = 160` reports 2 884 differing hunks (5 188 at the default
  width). A one-time reformat would conflict with every branch in flight, so there is no
  `rustfmt.toml` and `cargo fmt` is not run. Match the surrounding code by hand. Revisit
  when the branches are quiet; the reformat is then one commit of its own.
- **Long functions.** `clippy.toml` sets `too-many-lines-threshold = 150` and the editor
  and core enable `clippy::too_many_lines` outside tests. Existing offenders carry an
  explicit `#[allow(clippy::too_many_lines)]`; remove the allow when you split one.
- **Undo** stays snapshot based (`history.rs`): mutate the project freely, the history
  commits by comparison. Heavy payloads (part models, embedded documents) are shared
  with `Arc` so that comparison and cloning stay cheap.
- **No crate split (2026-10-24).** After the layering, `cargo check -p openecraft-core`
  from a clean build of the crate takes 16 s on the development machine, and the
  longest module files are `model.rs` (1 260 lines) and `reports.rs` (1 005 lines).
  That does not justify splitting the crate; the layer table gives the boundaries a
  split would follow if build time ever demands it (`model` + foundations, `analysis`
  with checks and reports, the output formats with `acadrust` and `jt` behind
  features).
- **Report names.** Since file format 2 pages, report blocks and forms name reports
  by their snake_case name (`ReportId`), so reports of plugins can be report pages.
  `ReportKind` stays the enum of the built-in kinds; files of format 1 are converted
  when opened.

Page property evaluation uses `sections` for local sheet numbers and section counts.
Symbol property blocks take their page/project context from the rendering caller;
part fields keep the selected function assignment. Page template property defaults
remain data in `model/page_templates.rs`, applied by the shared template insertion.
